# Mastermind
*Pretty Android version of the Mastermind code-breaking game*

## How to Play
Your goal is to guess a secret code that consists of a sequence of colored pegs.

In each round you make a guess and place the pegs on the board accordingly.

Once you made a guess, you get hints about how close you are to the real code:
- each black hint peg indicates one of your guess pegs is correct in both color and position
- each white hint peg indicates one of your guess pegs is correct in color but placed at the wrong position

Try to guess the code using as few rows as possible.

The game is lost if you use up all rows without guessing the correct code.
